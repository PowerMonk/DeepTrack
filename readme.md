# ðŸ¦‡ DeepTrack

I will start by saying, yes, this is completely vibecoded so if you get any bug, just use agent mode and fix it that way LOL.

# Why I created this and my definition of work

This app is built for me and whoever stands for similar things, I want to become someone I can only dream of, I want to save up money to go to Mexico City and be with the girl I like, but there is only one way of doing so, work work work!

I believe **work** is not only the one that gives an individual money:

- **studying** is work, sometimes actually harder than "work" since it develops your mind and actually makes you better.
- **working out** also counts as work, developing your body, a strong and calm mind goes a long way in like.
- **social time** counts as something worth counting, we would probably go insane without it.
- I also put work in there but, work is work so yeah lol.
- **Rest** is also something worth taking into account, for this one I don't think there is an explanation needed.

# How you should use the app

Set your daily goals and a weekly goal, daily goals could or _should_ be weekdays things, we all know weekends become unregular, but they also leave a threshold for some extra effort to be done.

A SQLite copy will be created in your device every day at 11:59pm, taking your daily progress so that you can use in the future in other apps or for statistics or whatever you want.

Use the download button to **create a csv** that will be downloaded to your device with your data up to that moment.

# Why it isn't ultra mega sofisticated

- First and foremost, I hate designing UI/UX, that's why this is completely vibecoded.
- Second, if you're an individual who actually cares about oneself, you will open the app and hit the button, it is literally a single button, if you're uncapable of doing that, you're probably uncapable of much more within your life.
- Third, I just want to read the book about databases I got, I needed this to 'just work', yk what they be saying.
